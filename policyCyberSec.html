<h1 class="title">Policy: Cyber-security</h1>

<div class="main">
    <h2>Why is Cyber-security important?</h2>

    <p>Cyber-security is an important issue for both IT departments and C-level executives. However, security should be a concern for each employee in an organization, not only IT professionals and top managers. One effective way to educate employees on the importance of security is a cyber-security policy that explains each person's responsibilities for protecting IT systems and data. A cyber-security policy sets the standards of behavior for activities such as the encryption of email attachments and restrictions on the use of social media.
    Cyber-security policies are important because cyberattacks and data breaches are potentially costly. At the same time, employees are often the weak links in an organization's security. Employees share passwords, click on malicious URLs and attachments, use unapproved cloud applications, and neglect to encrypt sensitive files.
    These types of policies are especially critical in public companies or organizations that operate in regulated industries such as healthcare, finance, or insurance. These organizations run the risk of large penalties if their security procedures are deemed inadequate.
    Even small firms not subjected to federal requirements are expected to meet minimum standards of IT security and could be prosecuted for a cyberattack which results in loss of consumer data if the organization is deemed negligent. Some states, such as California and New York, have instituted information security requirements for organizations conducting business in their states.
    Cyber-security policies are also critical to the public image and credibility of an organization. Customers, partners, shareholders, and prospective employees want evidence that the organization can protect its sensitive data. Without a cyber-security policy, an organization may not be able to provide such evidence.</p>
    
    <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
    
    <p>Privacy and data protection by design can be achieved by applying certain design strategies. We next enumerate the eight design strategies introduced by Jaap-Henk Hoepman (2014).
<br>1. Minimise. <br>System designers should ensure that only the minimal necessary personal information is collected.<br>Limit as much as possible the processing of personal data.<br>The most obvious strategy to protect privacy is to minimise the collection of personal data. Nothing can go wrong with data you do not collect: they cannot be abused, they cannot be misused, or get leaked accidentally. Think carefully about the personal data you really need. Sometimes a radically different approach may lead to a design that requires significantly less data, or may require no personal data at all.      
<br>2. Hide. <br>This strategy implies that the confidentiality of collected data is ensured, either by encrypting, pseudonymising or anonymising data in transit or in storage.<br>Protect personal data, or make it unlinkable or unobservable. Make sure it does not become public or known.<br>This important strategy targets the confidentiality, unlinkability and unobservability of personal data. This is in contrast to the minimise strategy that is aimed at explicitly deciding whether or not to process certain personal data at all. The adequate protection of personal data is a legal requirement.
<br>3. Separate. <br>Personal data should be stored and processed in a distributed way. <br><br>Separate the processing of personal data as much as possible.<br>Another important strategy is to (logically or physically) separate the processing of personal data. This makes it harder to combine or correlate data. By processing personal data from different contexts, the risk that data from one context becomes known in another context is reduced. Especially when the separation is physical. Hence separation implements contextual integrity.
<br>4. Abstract. <br>Storage of individualised data should be restricted as much as possible.<br><br>Limit as much as possible the detail in which personal data is processed.<br>While ‘minimise’ forces one to decide whether or not to process a particular piece of personal data, ‘abstract’ addresses the more subtle question of the level of detail in which to process personal data. The less detailed a personal data item is, the more we ‘zoom out’, the lower the privacy risk is.
<br>5. Inform. <br>Respondents should be made aware of what information about them is being collected and processed and for which reasons.<br>Inform data subjects about the processing of their personal data in a timely and adequate manner.<br>Transparency about which personal data is being processed, how they are processed and for which purpose, is an essential prerequisite for better privacy protection. It allows users to take informed decisions about using a system and agreeing to the processing of their personal data
<br>6. Control. <br>Respondents should be able to consult, modify and delete the information about them.<br>Provide data subjects adequate control over the processing of their personal data.<br>Control is a fundamental principle to protect the privacy of users. The main goal of privacy is not to totally prevent the processing and sharing of personal data. Not at all! But users want to have control and have a say in how their personal data is processed and shared.
<br>7. Enforce. <br>Privacy policies should be put in place and enforced.<b>Commit to processing personal data in a privacy-friendly way, and adequately enforce this.<br>Privacy should not only be guaranteed through technical means, but also through organisational means. It should be part of the organisational culture and be propagated by higher management. Otherwise nobody will feel responsible. A clear privacy policy will provide scope and guidance.
<br>8. Demonstrate. <br>Data controllers ought to document all collection and analysis processes conducted on personal information.<br>Demonstrate you are processing personal data in a privacy-friendly way.<br>This strategy addresses the new requirement that organisations need to demonstrate compliance to privacy regulations. The demonstrate strategy is externally oriented, towards the data protection authorities (possibly through the internal data protection officer).</p>
