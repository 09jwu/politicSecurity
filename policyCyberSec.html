<h1 class="title">Policy: Cyber-security</h1>

<div class="main">
    <h2>Why is Cyber-security important?</h2>

    <p>Cyber-security is an important issue for both IT departments and C-level executives. However, security should be a concern for each employee in an organization, not only IT professionals and top managers. One effective way to educate employees on the importance of security is a cyber-security policy that explains each person's responsibilities for protecting IT systems and data. A cyber-security policy sets the standards of behavior for activities such as the encryption of email attachments and restrictions on the use of social media.
    Cyber-security policies are important because cyberattacks and data breaches are potentially costly. At the same time, employees are often the weak links in an organization's security. Employees share passwords, click on malicious URLs and attachments, use unapproved cloud applications, and neglect to encrypt sensitive files.
    These types of policies are especially critical in public companies or organizations that operate in regulated industries such as healthcare, finance, or insurance. These organizations run the risk of large penalties if their security procedures are deemed inadequate.
    Even small firms not subjected to federal requirements are expected to meet minimum standards of IT security and could be prosecuted for a cyberattack which results in loss of consumer data if the organization is deemed negligent. Some states, such as California and New York, have instituted information security requirements for organizations conducting business in their states.
    Cyber-security policies are also critical to the public image and credibility of an organization. Customers, partners, shareholders, and prospective employees want evidence that the organization can protect its sensitive data. Without a cyber-security policy, an organization may not be able to provide such evidence.</p>
