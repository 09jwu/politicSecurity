    <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
    <p>
        Politic Security is a website which should be used to look at our political policies and to possibly contact us with any information on the usage of our expert knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
        This website seeks to reflect Politic Security's values. The site is designed to bring people under the one true ideology: scientology. Our policies secretly will end up monopolising the world's robot and security industries, which we then seek to control from the inside.
    </p>
    <p>
        The site is not intended as a mechanism for detailed replies to specific or individual cases, from Politic Security or its members. These are beast dealt with private correspondence or, better yet, none at all. Take our policies or leave them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Campaign communications with supporters will be delivered via the mechanisms provided on the platform. This media may change depending on changes to the platform over time.
    </p>

    <p>
        This document may be revised at any time by updating these terms and re-posting them here. We would recommend that you regularly check this document for any amendments, as once posted onto the site you will be expected to comply with them.
    </p>
    <p>
        There may be from time to time, more specific terms that outline internal company procedures, reflect changes in The Politic Security Rule Book, or for another reason require an amendment of the terms. If these more specific terms are posted on the site, they will take precedence.
